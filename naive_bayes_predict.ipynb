I\\\\'ve always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community.  You could build all these really cool places but people couldn\\\\'t interact in them.  You also couldn\\\\'t easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages.  I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista?) but it didn\\\\'t as far as we would have liked.  Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems.  It\\\\'s not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThanks to  urlLink Onebox.com  I should now be able to receive faxes.

The whole thing consists of William Gibson sitting in the back of a limo musing on everything from cyberspace to religion.  I\\\\'ll be doing a full review in Mindjack within the next couple of weeks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\'s what the Slashdot effect looks like.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mindjack today.     urlLink Twenty Twenty : Astronomical Vision by Chris McKinstry   \\\"Very early on a cold February morning in 1979 I looked with one of my highly astigmatic eyes through my first professional telescope at a setting Jupiter. Even with my flawed vision, the long white metal tube so finely manufactured it could have been a piece of sophisticated medical equipment, let the cloud bands of our solar system\\\\x92s largest planet and the bright points of a handful of its moons into my mind, making me feel a shadow of the shock that Galileo must have felt when he saw the same sight before any of us. \\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI redesigned  urlLink Mindjack  a bit.  It should load quite a bit faster now, and look better at lower resolutions.    New this week,  urlLink Design for Community  reviewed by David Brake.  Next week, an interview with Derek Powazek.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe new Infinite Matrix is up with a long excerpt of Cory Doctorow\\\\'s new novel,  urlLink Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom .  The Liberty Square ad-hocs were the staunchest conservatives in the Magic Kingdom, preserving the wheezing technology in the face of a Park that changed almost daily. The newcomer/old-timers were on-side with the rest of the Park, had their support, and looked like they might make a successful go of it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\'m the top left corner on Cory Doctorow\\\\'s  urlLink Four blogs on one page , which is one excuse why I haven\\\\'t been posting to this blog very much lately.

A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting.   Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience. One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. Working on an airplane or from a caf\\u00e9 just felt wrong.    This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If you\\\\'ve used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I\\\\'m talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you won\\\\'t go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I\\\\'ve stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I can\\\\'t choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all.    And it keeps on getting better. 802.11 isn\\\\'t just a technology, it\\\\'s a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If you\\\\'re in a major city, chances are you\\\\'ll find one before you go a block. Forget 3G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMindjack T-shirts are  urlLink now available .

I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations.   Wednesday night.  Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen. The theme of this international digital media festival was the \\\"4-D challenge\\\", to go beyond the third dimension. I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension. Now that I\\\\'ve spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself.  The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions. There was a soir\\u00e9e before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle. Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly. I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool. Business cards flowed like water.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI got an iBook!  OSX sure takes some ajusting to but I\\\\'m really impressed with it so far.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink Neil Gaiman  on whether someone should or should not be a writer:  And in answer to your question, if you worry about job security as a writer, that\\\\'s a very good indication that you aren\\\\'t a writer.

(They are miserable.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn the new Mindjack: a  urlLink report on SXSW Interactive  by Jon Lebkowksy, with photos by  urlLink Paul Bausch .   This year\\\\'s South by Southwest Interactive conference was lean and mean - attended mainly by the core group of edgy \\\\'net whackadistas, the conference had an interesting vibe, like \\\"Wow, glad the goddam dotcom splurge is over, let\\\\'s get back to what we were doin\\\\'\\\\x85\\\" And what we were doin\\\\' had real depth, it was way more compelling than ecommerce or net.publishing, the kinds of projects MBAs brought to the table when they started calling the Internet an \\\\'industry\\\\' and creating the concept of the IPO casino.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMindjack is back from a short break with a great article by Douglas Rushkoff:  urlLink Conforming to the Machine .\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you aren\\\\'t reading  urlLink futurefeedforward , you should be.   NEW YORK--ABC news magazine \\\"20/20\\\" reporter John Stossel, accidentally decapitated late last month while shooting a segment \\\"debunking the myth of wind power,\\\" returns to the air Wednesday in a special interview with 20/20 anchor Barbara Walters. \\\"It\\\\'s really an amazing story,\\\" explains Walters. \\\"Most people wouldn\\\\'t even survive decapitation, let alone have the guts, the determination, to keep doing their jobs. It\\\\'s a real triumph of the human spirit.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEveryone\\\\'s favorite Cory Doctorow, Cory Doctorow, has gotten a  urlLink new gig  at the EFF, which reminds me that I haven\\\\'t suported them nearly enough.

If there\\\\'s a message of the \\\\'for dummies\\\\' age it\\\\'s that nothing is beyond our grasp. And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhan\\\\'s meaning has been reduced to a one-liner. This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhan\\\\'s literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe new issue of Mindjack deals with one of my favorite topics:  urlLink Robots!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMy submission to the  urlLink Burn Baby Burn  mix CD swap, with dispraportionate amounts of Bowie and Reed, of course.   urlLink     (click to read tracklist)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff has started  urlLink a blog .

Really, it doesn\\\\'t seem to me that there are many comics being written for me. I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves. The Western medium has cycles, and it\\\\'s currently in a creative downturn. That doesn\\\\'t mean there isn\\\\'t excellent work being done. That simply means there\\\\'s not much of it. And, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me. Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that I don\\\\'t own a pair of Superman underpants.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHoward Rheingold  urlLink interviewed on NPR  (RealAudio link).

As you might be able to judge from some of my posts here, I\\\\'m a big fan of adventure games.  The traditional kind, where you can carry an enormous inventory in your pants, and explore the game at your own pace.  I\\\\'ve been thinking a lot about the genre lately and plan to write something about it soon, aside from reviews of the aforementioned games.  I\\\\'m interested in hearing your thoughts on adventure games.  Do you think there\\\\'s a place for them today?

Televisions up in the subways, instead of static ad bulletin boards! This is the future! It\\\\'s fun to see and fun to watch now. Soon it might be annoying or normal. But this first brush with more constant televisual stimulation was definitely exciting.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\'d like to comment on  urlLink Movielink , the new studio-approved online movie rental service, but unfortunately this is all I\\\\'m able to see:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSign #249  urlLink CNN  needs some sense slapped into them:  it\\\\'s the day after an election, Republicans have taken control the Senate, Dick Gephardt is stepping down as House minority leader and right now, on Larry King, they\\\\'re talking about the Winona Ryder verdict.  At least they took down the  BREAKING NEWS  graphic.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\'s a  urlLink new trailer  for Steven Soderbergh\\\\'s  Solaris  up today -- one of the movies I\\\\'m most looking forward this fall.

Which I hope to review for Mindjack before the new film\\\\'s released.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCory Doctorow  urlLink reviews Smart Mobs  in the new Mindjack:    Smart Mobs are the Slashdot effect applied to the meatspace zeitgeist. A squillion like-minded souls who don\\\\'t know each other and will never meet pop out of the transmetropolitan brickface and break the white-noise balance of atomic viewpoints to speak with one voice, roaring a righteous YES or an adamant NO without organizers, without leaders, without manifestoes or forethought.   Also this issue, an in-depth look at  urlLink the Internet Archive  by Doug Roberts.   Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three. Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with 15-foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling. To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Baker\\\\'s racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on it\\\\'s side to maximize the space. Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully. Walking into this echoey, over-warm warehouse space, it\\\\'s easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from 1996 until today.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMindjack is back after a short break.  The new issue has  urlLink a report  on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts.  Supernova 2002 was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach, the organizer along with pulver.com, acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days. The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future. Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example. No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system. Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade. By then end of day one, however, it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI just discovered through  urlLink Smartmobs.com  that Clive Thompson has a  urlLink blog .  It\\\\'s great.

The panel will discuss the birth of blogging, the emergent tension between blogs and traditional journalism, innovations in blogging such as video-blogging, audio-blogging, and mobile-blogging, the shifting roles of race and gender in the Blogosphere, the state of the blog economy, and the way blogs may be reshaping contemporary media.

He was a much brighter, open-minded, and - if I might add - cosmic thinker than I gave him credit for, before. I felt like he was really one of \\\"us,\\\" if you know what I mean: the kids in college who got those wild thoughts about how everything in the world, and even beyond, is connected somehow. And evolving. Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States, and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mindjack up today!

The next day, across town, his powerbook scorching the flesh off his legs, he beams it over to me in England. I put it up on a private server for Fraction in Kansas City and Laurenn in San Francisco, while reading the first few chapters of Cory\\\\'s new book, which he sent to me from an airport a few days before, squatting by the power outlet next to the public toilets.  urlLink continued...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSlashdot launches  urlLink games.slashdot.org  and, holy cow, it\\\\'s ugly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMindjack contributor and game reviewer, Justin Hall, has written a great article on  urlLink ethics in video game journalism  for the Online Journalism Review.  The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in 1981.  Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: \\\\x93To an extent, we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games, we wanted to see more of them, we wanted to keep writing about them.\\\\x94  Not much has changed in the past 20 years.  Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis is incredible.  Scientists have discovered a \\\"Colossal\\\" squid in the Antartic, much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found.  And it\\\\'s not even fully grown.  Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration.  Just imagine that there\\\\'s something like this that no one has ever seen alive.  It\\\\'s interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel.  While it\\\\'s great there\\\\'s some funding available, just as with space exploration, there should be much more.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGoogling for sites that mention Mindjack, other than mindjack.com, suprisingly results in 5,800 links.

If you want to write for us, drop an email.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\'m pleased to announce that VRML creator and all-around visionary Mark Pesce has joined Mindjack\\\\'s ever-growing stable of writers.  His first article,   urlLink Redefining Television  , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium.  Here\\\\'s a snippet:   In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in  1984  and Ray Bradbury in  Fahrenheit 451  projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they weren\\\\'t that far off the mark. But here\\\\'s the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. Actually, they\\\\'ve already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this.  To understand why, we need to go back to first principles. What is television? Here\\\\'s a functional definition:   Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images.   This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era. Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\'m using this blog to play around with  urlLink Blogger\\\\'s new features .

UML is a notation for visually expressing object-oriented concepts; RUP is a process framework that uses the UML to express the content of its artifacts and tasks. But what do RUP and the UML offer that portion of our software community doing non-object oriented development? This article is my answer to that question. As we shall see, RUP and UML can be used quite effectively on software projects in COBOL, C, or even (the dreaded) assembler language.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink ALLPM - The Project Managers HomePage :: The Project Managers HomePage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink The PMFORUM - For Advancement Project Management Learning : \\\"PMFORUM\\u00ae provides instant  access  to world-wide project management information.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink Max Wideman\\\\'s Musings Web Log : \\\"Max Wideman is an engineer and professional project manager with experience in systems, social and environmental projects, as well as design and engineering projects.

Why is the sky blue?  Do fish drink?  Why does the moon follow us?  Given your developing command of language and curiosity, it was an easy and rewarding way to augment your experience of the world. By the time you reached six or seven years old, you probably stopped asking so many questions about the things around you. Perhaps you realized that the endless stream of questions began to annoy more than charm your parents. Perhaps you learned how to find the answers yourself. Perhaps, as many learning theorists suggest, your schooling had acclimated you to posing \\\"appropriate\\\" questions and giving \\\"correct\\\" answers.  In my master\\\\x92s project thesis, I hope to reawaken and re-enable this spirit of inquiry and engagement in the world for adult learners, through the development of an interconnected set of services I call free range learning support.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink NetworkMoves\\\\x97The Monthly Newsletter Highlighting Career and Business Networking Ideas   The ready availability of information on the Internet makes it easy for people to do free background checks on people before entering into business relationships.

However, I\\\\x92m not real  sure if I agree that such online or IT based knowledge communities are  real \\\\x93knowledge\\\\x94 networks that allow for knowledge building, or rather  if they are actually more to the tune of \\\\x93information\\\\x94 centers.  Velocity - the speed with which knowledge moves through an organization  (1)  Viscosity - the richness or thickness of the knowledge transferred (1)  Mobil Oil\\\\'s engineers developed some sophisticated ways of determining  how much steam is required to drill under certain conditions.  When  they applied their techniques, they found they could reduce the amount  of steam they generated themselves and bought from outside sources.   Since they knew the precise amount needed, the potential savings were  huge.  So they embedded the technique in an intelligent system, with  the main focus being the knowledge\\\\'s velocity in order to quickly get  the information out to the field.  This was done by sending a memo to  all the drilling operations detailing the calculations and benefits.   They assumed other sites would quickly adapt the innovation.  Nothing  happened.  The effective viscosity level was zero.  Simply improving a process will not be enough to win over everyone.  So  Mobil came up with some other techniques for transferring the  knowledge, such as videos and case studies and soon raised the adoption  rate to 30%.  It now looks as if it will grow to 50%.  Will it ever  reach 100%?  Who knows?  The resistance to abandoning processes that  have been successful for years is a universal phenomenon and is not  just limited to Mobil.  Velocity strips knowledge and information down to its bare essentials  by removing portions of its context and richness.  And this stripping  effect often takes the message down to the next level for its intended  receivers-- from knowledge to information or from information to data.   Thus the intended knowledge exchange fails.  Now look at how 3M does it -- they have regular meetings and fairs for  exchanging knowledge.  One of their most famous products, scotch tape,  was invented by Dick Drew...a sandpaper salesman.  In almost any other  company his idea would have been tossed out as tape and research were  not his specialty, yet the culture of 3M allows for the \\\"viscosity\\\" of  information to be spread.  And the way they ensure it spreads is  through meetings and knowledge fairs -- it is not left for a chance  happening on their intranet.  In the article, Professor Yamazaki writes, \\\\x93High-context based  communities in many Japanese companies have been gradually crumbling.\\\\x94   Perhaps this might be part of Japan\\\\'s problems -- the replacement of  communities where knowledge exchanges can likely occur with online  communities that often work better as information exchanges.  No don\\\\'t  get me wrong, both knowledge and information exchanges can occur in  either type of community, however, it is easier to exchange knowledge  in certain types of environments.  Being online allows one to gather a lot of information, yet the vary  nature of it \\\\x96 speed, works against it as being a knowledge-enabler.   Knowledge requires rich sources and context.  For example, one of the  best knowledge-enablers for a beginning learner is apprenticeship as it  allows a rich exchange of concepts and ideas between the learner and  teacher.  As one starts to slowly move away from this form of learning,  the knowledge exchange slowly starts to decrease, while the rate of  information flow increases.  That is, in a class, the information is  going out to a number of learners at once, hence the speed of  information exchange increases; however, the flip-side is that  one-on-one interactions decrease, thus the rate of knowledge transfer  decreases.  This is the first dimension of the  data/information/knowledge continuum \\\\x96 Viscosity/Velocity.  The second dimension of the data/information/knowledge continuum is the  number of paths or streams of information flow.  A single email  (monophonic) sent to a direct report is one stream, where as this list  normally has multiple posts (context) to each thread.  The more posts,  then the more viewpoints one can gather or harvest.  Once a learner  moves past the beginner stage, then these multiple viewpoints start to  become invaluable as they add context to the knowledge base that one  has gained.  For example, A PhD student studies one small section of  his or her field, but does so from multiple contexts.  There is a diagram showing these various relations at: http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/km/knowledge2.jpg  Throughout the various Knowledge Communities and Communities of  Practice, there are different levels of information and knowledge  exchanges.  So how does one determine if the community is mainly an  information exchange or a knowledge creator or builder?  What practices  have to be put in place to raise a information exchange to a knowledge  exchange?  For example, in Professor Yamazaki\\\\'s PowerPoint slide, there  is a facilitator for helping with the \\\"stroking\\\" of the members.  Is  this enough to ensure the exchange of knowledge?  Another example is  this list -- when does it help to build or exchange knowledge rather  that just exchange information?  Must there be participation or can one  just read the postings and become knowledgeable?  Or are they simply  becoming \\\"informed\\\\'?  NOTES 1. Thomas H.

The concept of testable requirements meets these needs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink John Blade\\\\'s Homepage ? wp-mail.php\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink SAP - SAP NetWeaver Home   The Open Integration and Application Platform Can your company adapt quickly enough to respond to new challenges or seize new opportunities?

And one of the main appeals of RSA and DSA authentication is the promise of being able to establish connections to remote systems without supplying a password. The keychain bash script makes handling RSA and DSA keys both convenient and secure. It acts as a front-end to ssh-agent, allowing you to easily have one long-running ssh-agent process per system, rather than per login session.

Integrated with the Common Language Runtime  - IronPython code can easily use CLR libraries and Python classes can extend CLR classes.    Fully dynamic  - IronPython supports an interactive interpreter and transparent on-the-fly compilation of source files just like standard Python.    Optionally static  - IronPython also supports static compilation of Python code to produce static executables (.exe\\\\'s) that can be run directly or static libraries (.dll\\\\'s) that can be called from other CLR languages including C#, VB, managed C++ and many more.    Managed and verifiable  - IronPython generates verifiable assemblies with no dependencies on native libraries that can run in environments which require verifiable managed code.    Not finished  - IronPython is currently at a pre-alpha stage suitable for experimentation but not for serious development work. \\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nurlLink s9y PHP weblog software - Serendipity : \\\"Serendipity is a weblog/blog system, implemented with PHP.

Archived Column\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ni have no idea what to put here\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI really am in the wrong line of work. Hospitality. I couldn\\\\'t be any less hospitable if I tried. Don\\\\'t get me wrong, I\\\\'m very polite to customers. I always smile and say Hello! But it only takes the SLIGHTEST wrong doing on their part and I quickly turn. People really do leave their manners at the door. I refuse to be polite to people who wont return the favour. Here is a wee list of things that really piss me off. Little things that have started to fester and turned into the biggest deals on earth. I know they may seem LITTLE, but you try having it happen to you day and and day out. YOU JUST TRY IT. And yes I know i could quit but I dont wanna.  1. Thowing money on the counter. You may as well be throwing money at your feet and telling me to beg for it. FUCK YOU. 2. Not saying please or thank you. It\\\\'s pretty basic. 3. Having me say Hello! and the customer just saying GIVE ME THIS and not even LOOKING at you. Fuck that makes me mad. 4.Whinging about the cost. You knew how much it was when you were ordering it.  5. Getting mad at ME because they have to wait in a line. Dont wait in the LINE THEN. 6. Talking on your cellphone while a big line forms behind you and putting your hand IN MY FACE TO STOP ME ASKING WHAT YOU WANT. This happens ALL THE TIME. So rude.  7. People leaving their tables in a filthy mess of sugar packets and food scraps. Like they had a crazy feeding frenzy. Disgusting pigs.  Today a lady asked my co-worker to please put butter on her muffin for her, which she was taking away with her. She stood there and directed where abouts and how much butter to put in which places. Why must people degrade us this way? What the fuck is wrong with your hands that you cant do it? the only time somebody has ever asked me to do that was when they had two CASTS on their arms. Am I the only one who thinks this is DISGUSTING? I was so mad I could have split. I could write for days and days about how mad my job makes me. But just when you think you cant stand seeing another UNGREATFUL THANKLESS ASSHOLE, somebody lovely comes in and is actually NICE to you and you feel all better.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBonjour.  Today I saw an event which made me cry for the state of the world and rejoice the goodness of others all in the space of a few seconds. Which is a common theme i guess...good and evil etc...etc. Yawn. Anyway here\\\\'s the story.  So there I was, standing at work with no customers to tend to, staring out into the early night sky and the brightly lit street. Watching people walking home from work, clad in woolen jackets, briskly rubbing woolen hands tog--anyways, SUDDENLY these three \\\"kids\\\" come along, one of them in a wheelchair pretending to be mentally disabled with the other two kicking the chair yelling RETARD!! That probably sounds like it was funny, but it really wasn\\\\'t. I dont mean that in an overly sensitive girl way, either. It was just depressing. Like, what the hell?  Then! Suddenly a grown man RACES up, grabbing one of the kids by the scruff of the neck and cries \\\"DONT YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN YOU INSENSITIVE FUCKING LITTLE PRICK\\\" and the kids REELED back in TERROR. It was like an inaudable cheer went up all over wellington! Finally! Somebody had enough guts to say HEY!! WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS HORRIBLY UNACCEPTABLE!! It was a great moment indeed. I felt slightly elated. I felt as though this would be how I would deal to situations from now on. No more sitting back and watching it happen, no sir. Then I realised that I wouldn\\\\'t change at all and I felt ashamed and depressed for a moment, then I stopped thinking about it altogether because somebody came into the store and started DEMANDING a drink. No need for manners! I DONT HAVE FEELINGS I\\\"M JUST A ROBOT SLAVE. Oops, always off on the tangents.  Bye!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis is a \\\"rant\\\" about something that sometimes really pisses me off. It\\\\'s not really a big deal, and if this is all i have to worry about then i should be glad BLAH BLAH WHATEVER, but I still feel I am entitled to be mad about it and VENT MY RAGE in text, here it is.  My boyfriend, lets call him \\\"Tim\\\", never EVER does anything to help me keep the house tidy. I don\\\\'t mean insanely tidy, i just mean a low-level kind of tidy. Comfortable tidy. I have a lot of stuff, so things get untidy easily. Tim does not do one single thing to help my cause. It was okay before, when he was earning all the money and I just sat at home eating chocolates and watching Dr Phil, but now i give him most of the money I earn slaving away at my job six days a week. I contribute! But the burden of having to look after EVERYTHING is still firmly rested on my shoulders.   Tim looks after the bills and makes sure everything gets paid, etc, etc. But that only takes a few minutes because he does it all ONLINE LIKE A BIG NERD. I spend at least two hours a day doing washing and making beds and so on and so on and so on. Sometimes I say...Hey tim, maybe you could do the dishes tonight, i\\\\'m really tired. Sure! he says, \\\"I\\\\'ll do it tomorrow, before i go to work.\\\" .....what?  Here\\\\'s a little example of a typical situation that pisses me off so much i feel like taking a knife and slashing my own face to bits so i can go to hospital and not have to do any housework f--anyway, here\\\\'s an example. Tim likes to take his clothes off before he goes to bed in the LOUNGE. and leave them on the CHAIR and on the floor. Apparently its warmer in there. I dont need to go into the ten million reasons why this is a completely idiotic reason, as I feel it is fairly apprent. Next day, Oh, my SHIRTS ALL CRUMPLED, Liz can you IRON it for me? Cue sad face. His, not mine, mines more of a rage face. Liz if you get time before work and inbetween cleaning my underpants can you please wash all my shirts for me? Ta.  The fact that I have to tidy things away seems to be the reasoning behind the fact Tim can never FIND anything. You tidyed it away! Where have you put my \\\"......\\\". He totally flips out. This morning i was woken up at 7:30 AM on the day of my ONLY sleep in, because \\\"LIZ I HAVE LOST MY WALLET\\\" so i get up. Stumble around the house and say HEY\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen letter to: My Future Internet Friend  Hi! How are you? I am fine.

Today was completely reproachable in every respect. Thousands of greedy, impatient and most noticably obsese and ugly customers were in a continuous state of trying to jam themselves through the narrow entrance of the shop. While the three of us coward behind the counter desperatly trying to throw together drinks and food orders while they stood sullen and homourless, alternating from staring at their watches to staring at us with their evil, unforgiving eyes. After lurching around trying to please everyone for around five solid hours we were then given the luxury of closing the shop and spending two hours washing their cheap waxy lipstick from the rims of the cups. Oh, thanks for stomping your stale cookie into the carpet, that really made my fucking day.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWell dedicated readers, it\\\\'s been a while since my last post (as you must have noticed! dont worry!! i didnt commit suicide! even though i threatened to in my quit message, soz :/) but i\\\\'m back now and ready to regale and entertain you all!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHi!  Whenever I\\\\'m feeling lame enough to keep a \\\"diary\\\" or write stuff places in say...a BLOG, I cant ever write anything when something important is happening. My diarys always die out when something great has happened or something depressing has happened, then I feel I cant pick them up again without some kind of explaination to myself about it. In written form. Which I really struggle with. So I thought I should break that now so I will write something here again.  On the weekend I got engaged! To be MARRIED! OMG.

This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages.
